Virulence functions include numerous capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis systems that are controlled by invertible promoters that are recombined by a site-specific recombinase, Mpi, that works at a set of inverted repeats found within the chromosome. This system allows a vast repertoire of variable antigens to be expressed, thereby aiding evasion of the immune system.

Current nutritional interventions have been largely ineffective in overcoming stunting, emphasizing the need to obtain better understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Finding that treating Bangladeshi children with severe acute malnutrition with therapeutic foods reduces plasma levels of a biomarker of osteoclastic activity but does not change biomarkers of osteoblastic activity, improve their severe stunting, or overcome their persistent impaired gut microbiota development, we turned to a gnotobiotic mouse model to characterize interactions between the microbiota, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), and osteoclast and osteoblast biology. Young germ-free mice were colonized with a consortium of cultured bacterial strains from a 6-month-old stunted infant and fed a diet representative of that consumed by the donor population, with or without sialylated milk oligosaccharides purified from bovine milk (S-BMO) that are also present in human milk. In colonized mice, S-BMO produced increases in femoral trabecular bone volume and cortical thickness, reductions in osteoclasts and their bone marrow myeloid progenitors, accompanying changes in regulators of osteoclastogenesis and mediators of Th2 responses, including increases in gut eosinophils, while osteoblast activity was unaffected. Comparisons of germ-free and colonized mice revealed S-BMO- and microbiota-dependent increases in cecal levels of succinate, increased numbers of small intestinal tuft cells, and accompanying changes in gene expression indicative of activation of a succinate-induced tuft cell-associated, signaling pathway that triggers a Type 2 immune response. 2’-Fucosylactose (2’-FL), a prominent fucosylated HMO, failed to elicit these effects on bone biology. Our results underscore the need to further characterize the balance between osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity in stunted infants/children, provide preclinical evidence of the gut microbiota as a determinant of bone growth in the context of undernutrition, and suggest that certain HMOs may have therapeutic utility in this setting.;Human fecal bacterial isolate annotated genome sequence","2019-10-02T21:48:19.190Z","2019-10-02T21:48:19.190Z"

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","2020-07-01T03:48:48.994Z","2020-07-01T03:48:48.994Z"

Here, we show that gnotobiotic mice colonized with microbiota from undernourished Bangladeshi children and fed a Bangladeshi diet exhibited microbiota- dependent differences in mucosal IgA responses to oral vaccination with cholera toxin (CT). Supplementation with a nutrient-rich diet consisting of spirulina, amaranth, flaxseed and micronutrients augmented CT-IgA production. Mice initially colonized with a microbiota associated with poor CT responses exhibited improved immunogenicity upon invasion of bacterial taxa from cagemates colonized with a more ‘responsive’ microbiota. Additionally, a consortium of five cultured bacterial invaders conferred augmented CT-IgA responses in mice fed the supplemented diet and colonized with the ‘hypo- responsive’ community. These results provide preclinical proof-of-concept that diet and microbiota influence mucosal immune responses to CT vaccination and identify a candidate synbiotic formulation.","2020-07-02T08:17:00.451Z","2020-07-02T08:17:00.451Z"

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","2021-09-29T19:39:58.368Z","2021-09-29T19:39:58.368Z"
