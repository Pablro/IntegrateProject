Using an approach inspired by statistical methods applied to financial markets and proteins, we conducted an analysis of covariance among bacterial taxa in the gut microbiota of healthy members of a Bangladeshi birth cohort sampled monthly from 1 to 60 months. Their microbiota can be decomposed into a sparse unit of 15 covarying bacterial taxa (an 'ecogroup'). A single ecogroup configuration is evident by the second postnatal month, and evolves in distinct phases to a mature form by 21 months, as defined by relative species abundance and architecture of microbial coupling. 'Ecogroup' provides a concise description of the organization of the gut microbiota in healthy versus undernourished children, a parameter for defining the extent of community repair achieved in the latter group by microbiota-directed foods and a framework for studying emergent characteristics of microbial communities.","2019-10-03T08:17:28.852Z","2019-10-03T08:17:28.852Z"

Combining metabolomic and proteomic analyses of serially collected plasma samples with metagenomic analyses of fecal samples, we characterized the biological state of Bangladeshi children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) as they transitioned, following standard treatment, to moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with persistent microbiota immaturity. Gnotobiotic mice were subsequently colonized with a defined consortium of bacterial strains representing different stages of microbiota development in healthy children. Administering different combinations of Bangladeshi complementary food ingredients to colonized and germ-free mice revealed diet-dependent changes in the relative abundance and metabolism of weaning-phase bacterial taxa underrepresented in SAM and MAM microbiota, plus diet- and colonization-dependent effects on host metabolism and growth-associated signaling pathways. Host and microbial effects of microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) prototypes were subsequently examined in gnotobiotic mice colonized with post-SAM MAM microbiota and in gnotobiotic piglets colonized with a defined consortium of targeted age- and growth-discriminatory bacteria. Finally, a randomized, double-blind study identified a lead MDCF that changes the abundances of targeted bacterial taxa and increases plasma levels of biomarkers and mediators of growth, bone formation, neurodevelopment, and immune function.","2019-10-03T08:35:27.904Z","2019-10-03T08:35:27.904Z"

As we observed that beside B. longum subsp. infantis and B. bifidum, an isolate of B. longum subsp. suis and strains of B. kashiwanohense were able to grow in the presence of fucosyllactose, we further investigated metabolites formed during L-fucose and fucosyllactose utilization, and aimed to identify genes and pathways involved through genome comparison of the Kenyan isolates B. longum subsp. infantis TPY11-1, B. longum subsp. suis BSM11-5, B. kashiwanohense PV20-2 and the B. kashiwanohense type strain DSM 21854, to the well characterized type strain B. longum subsp. infantis DSM 20088.We report that the ability to utilize fucosyllactose is a trait of various bifidobacteria species. We identified strains of B. longum subsp. infantis and an isolate of B. longum subsp. suis were able to use L-fucose to form 1,2-PD. As 1,2-PD is a precursor for intestinal propionate formation, bifidobacterial L-fucose utilization might affect the intestinal SCFA balance with final impact on infant gut health. A L-fucose utilization pathway for bifidobacteria is suggested.","2019-07-18T03:01:19.527Z","2019-07-18T03:01:19.527Z"

Current nutritional interventions have been largely ineffective in overcoming stunting, emphasizing the need to obtain better understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Finding that treating Bangladeshi children with severe acute malnutrition with therapeutic foods reduces plasma levels of a biomarker of osteoclastic activity but does not change biomarkers of osteoblastic activity, improve their severe stunting, or overcome their persistent impaired gut microbiota development, we turned to a gnotobiotic mouse model to characterize interactions between the microbiota, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), and osteoclast and osteoblast biology. Young germ-free mice were colonized with a consortium of cultured bacterial strains from a 6-month-old stunted infant and fed a diet representative of that consumed by the donor population, with or without sialylated milk oligosaccharides purified from bovine milk (S-BMO) that are also present in human milk. In colonized mice, S-BMO produced increases in femoral trabecular bone volume and cortical thickness, reductions in osteoclasts and their bone marrow myeloid progenitors, accompanying changes in regulators of osteoclastogenesis and mediators of Th2 responses, including increases in gut eosinophils, while osteoblast activity was unaffected. Comparisons of germ-free and colonized mice revealed S-BMO- and microbiota-dependent increases in cecal levels of succinate, increased numbers of small intestinal tuft cells, and accompanying changes in gene expression indicative of activation of a succinate-induced tuft cell-associated, signaling pathway that triggers a Type 2 immune response. 2’-Fucosylactose (2’-FL), a prominent fucosylated HMO, failed to elicit these effects on bone biology. Our results underscore the need to further characterize the balance between osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity in stunted infants/children, provide preclinical evidence of the gut microbiota as a determinant of bone growth in the context of undernutrition, and suggest that certain HMOs may have therapeutic utility in this setting.;Human fecal bacterial isolate annotated genome sequence","2019-07-18T03:34:20.973Z","2019-07-18T03:34:20.973Z"

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations. These freely available genomic resources should greatly facilitate investigations into the human gut microbiome.","2019-10-03T13:39:20.283Z","2019-10-03T13:39:20.283Z"

Defining the incidence of this disorder, its pathophysiological features, and its contribution to impaired linear and ponderal growth has been hampered by the difficulty in directly sampling the small intestinal mucosa and microbial community (microbiota). METHODS In this study, among 110 young children (mean age, 18 months) with linear growth stunting who were living in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and had not benefited from a nutritional intervention, we performed endoscopy in 80 children who had biopsy-confirmed EED and available plasma and duodenal samples. We quantified the levels of 4077 plasma proteins and 2619 proteins in duodenal biopsy samples obtained from these children. The levels of bacterial strains in microbiota recovered from duodenal aspirate from each child were determined with the use of culture-independent methods. In addition, we obtained 21 plasma samples and 27 fecal samples from age-matched healthy children living in the same area. Young germ-free mice that had been fed a Bangladeshi diet were colonized with bacterial strains cultured from the duodenal aspirates. RESULTS Of the bacterial strains that were obtained from the children, the absolute levels of a shared group of 14 taxa (which are not typically classified as enteropathogens) were negatively correlated with linear growth (length-for-age z score, r=−0.49; P=0.003) and positively correlated with duodenal proteins involved in immunoinflammatory responses. The representation of these 14 duodenal taxa in fecal microbiota was significantly different from that in samples obtained from healthy children (P<0.001 by permutational multivariate analysis of variance). Enteropathy of the small intestine developed in gnotobiotic mice that had been colonized with cultured duodenal strains obtained from children with EED. CONCLUSIONS These results provide support for a causal relationship between growth stunting and components of the small intestinal microbiota and enteropathy and offer a rationale for developing therapies that target these microbial contributions to EED.

Recent experiments in animal and human studies have generated growing evidence for the association of gut microbiome and development of these diseases. Using next generation sequencing, large amounts of metagenomic data have been generated from T2D and control subjects. However, the disease-associated prokaryotic repertoire of the human gut microbiota is still undefined. Here we identified 389 uncultured novel prokaryotic species, including 388 bacteria and 1 archaea, by reconstructing 95871 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 5814 disease-associated human gut microbiomes and de-replicating the MAGs against a comprehensive human gut library (ERP108418).
